Fix problems with current command line default pipe feature where sometimes
you have to explicitly specify pipes.

Martijn van Oosterhout suggested the following:

Actually, there is an easier. If new inputs got attached to the *last*
available output, it would work also without naming pipes. So the
outputs form a stack. Like so:

--read-xml    Stack: read-xml output.0
--read-change-xml   Stack: read-xml output.0 read-change-xml output.0
--sort-change-xml
   Input gets attached to read-change-xml output.0
   Stack: read-xml output.0  sort-change-xml output.0
--apply-change  Inputs getattached in order.

Note for the last you have two inputs, they also have to be applied in
reverse order.

Martijn van Oosterhout suggested that the command line is too long.

I think the lengthof the commandline is also an obsticle. Perhaps you
could have something like:

osmosis 'read-xml "foo" (read-change-xml "bar" | sort-change-xml ) |
apply-change'

A bit confusing with the multiple input pipes, but it's clearer if you
know shell...

**********
Application output is not configurable.  This needs to be made configurable
allowing default output, verbose output, or quiet output.
Requires support for "global" command line options that aren't related to any tasks.

********** DONE
Combine entity stream task for merging two data files.
Combine change stream task for merging two change files.

********** DONE
Add bzip2 support (more important because this is used by current planet files).
Add gzip support.

**********
Add ability to create new entities as part of change as well as simply replicate creates (with existing ids) from one place to another.

**********
An API download task.  Marcus Wolschon has already written this, I just have to make a couple of minor changes before applying it into the codebase.

**********
An API upload task.  This will duplicate the functionality of Martijn's bulk_import.pl so has slipped in priority.  Once the kinks have been ironed out in that tool I'll re-use the ideas.

**********
A new task for dumping "current" tables.  This might be useful in the short term to speed up planet creation.

**********
Complete the changeset application code in --write-mysql-change and add "placeholder" functionality to allow new entities to be created.

**********
Add referential integrity checking to database writing code.

**********
Add a task for reading and writing changes from JOSM style change files.

**********
A new cron or daemon run osmosis-extract application for producing regular changesets (ie. daily snapshots or perhaps even less).

**********
Add progress reporting features to osmosis tasks so you can tell where it's up to.

**********
Requested by Tom Hughes.
Add a polygon filtering task allowing more complex filtering than existing bounding box task.

**********
Requested by Tom Hughes.
Add a reporting task showing all editing users (to be used in conjunction with polygon filter.
This implies adding user support to osmosis and should include reading/writing user info to xml files.
