This page describes the complete set of command line options available
for the Osmosis tool.

Global Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Short Option |Long Option |Description
|-v |-verbose |Specifies that increased logging should be enabled.

|-v x |-verbose x |x is a positive integer specifying the amount of
increased logging, 0 is equivalent to the -v option alone.

|-q |-quiet |Specifies that reduced logging should be enabled.

|-q x |-quiet x |x is a positive integer specifying the amount of
increased logging, 0 is equivalent to the -q option alone.

|-p |-plugin |Allows an external plugin to be loaded. is the name of a
class implementing the com.bretth.osmosis.core.plugin.PluginLoader
interface. This option may be specified multiple times to load multiple
plugins.
|=======================================================================

Default Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some tasks can accept un-named or "default" arguments. In the tasks
description, the argument name will be followed by "(default)".

For example, the --read-xml task has a file argument which may be
unnamed. The following two command lines are equivalent.

....
osmosis --read-xml file=myfile.osm --write-null
....

....
osmosis --read-xml myfile.osm --write-null
....

Built-In Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All tasks default to 0.6 versions from release 0.31 onwards.

0.6 tasks were first introduced in release 0.30. 0.5 tasks were dropped
as of version 0.36. 0.4 tasks were dropped as of version 0.22.

API Database Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tasks are to be used with the schema that backs the OSM API. These
tasks support the 0.6 database only, and support both PostgreSQL and
MySQL variants. It is highly recommended to use PostgreSQL due to the
better testing it receives.

|=====================================

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description |Valid Values |Default Value
|file (default) |The name of the osm file to be read, "-" means STDIN. |
|dump.osm

|enableDateParsing |If set to yes, the dates in the osm xml file will be
parsed, otherwise all dates will be set to a single time approximately
equal to application startup. Setting this to no is only useful if the
input file doesn't contain timestamps. It used to improve performance
but date parsing now incurs low overhead. |yes, no |yes

|compressionMethod |Specifies the compression method that has been used
to compress the file. If "auto" is specified, the compression method
will be automatically determined from the file name (*.gz=gzip,
*.bz2=bzip2). |auto, none, gzip, bzip2 |auto
|=======================================================================

--fast-read-xml (no short option available)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

0.6 only. As per the --read-xml task but using a STAX XML parser instead
of SAX for improved performance. This has undergone solid testing and
should be reliable but all xml processing tasks have not yet been
re-written to use the new implementation thus is not the default yet.

Area Filtering Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These tasks can be used to retrieve data by filtering based on the
location of interest.

--bounding-box (--bb)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Extracts data within a specific bounding box defined by lat/lon
coordinates.

See also : Osmosis#Extracting_bounding_boxes

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=====================================
|Pipe |Description
|inPipe.0 |Consumes an entity stream.
|outPipe.0 |Produces an entity stream.
|=====================================

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description |Valid Values |Default Value
|left |The longitude of the left edge of the box. |-180 to 180 |-180

|right |The longitude of the right edge of the box. |-180 to 180 |180

|top |The latitude of the top edge of the box. |-90 to 90 |90

|bottom |The latitude of the bottom edge of the box. |-90 to 90 |-90

|x1 |Slippy map coordinate of the left edge of the box | |

|y1 |Slippy map coordinate of the top edge of the box | |

|x2 |Slippy map coordinate of the right edge of the box | |x1

|y2 |Slippy map coordinate of the bottom edge of the box | |y1

|zoom |Slippy map zoom | |12

|completeWays |Include all available nodes for ways which have at least
one node in the bounding box. Supersedes cascadingRelations. |yes, no
|no

|completeRelations |Include all available relations which are members of
relations which have at least one member in the bounding box. Implies
completeWays. Supersedes cascadingRelations. |yes, no |no

|cascadingRelations |If a relation is selected for inclusion, always
include all its parents as well. Without this flag, whether or not the
parent of an included relation is included can depend on the order in
which they appear - if the parent relation is processed but at the time
it is not known that it will become "relevant" by way of a child
relation, then it is not included. With this flag, all relations are
read before a decision is made which ones to include. This flag is not
required, and will be ignored, if either completeWays or
completeRelations is set, as those flags automatically create a
temporary list of all relations and thus allow proper parent selection.
cascadingRelations, however, uses less resources than those options
because it only requires temporary storage for relations. |yes, no |no

|idTrackerType |Specifies the memory mechanism for tracking selected
ids. BitSet is more efficient for very large bounding boxes (where node
count is greater than 1/32 of maximum node id), IdList will be more
efficient for all smaller bounding boxes. Dynamic breaks the overall id
range into small segments and chooses the most efficient of IdList or
BitSet for that interval. |BitSet, IdList, Dynamic |Dynamic

|clipIncompleteEntities |Specifies what the behaviour should be when
entities are encountered that have missing relationships with other
entities. For example, ways with missing nodes, and relations with
missing members. This occurs most often at the boundaries of selection
areas, but may also occur due to referential integrity issues in the
database or inconsistencies in the planet file snapshot creation. If set
to true the entities are modified to remove the missing references,
otherwise they're left intact. |true, false |false
|=======================================================================

If both lat/lon and slippy map coordinates are used then lat/lon
coordinates are overriden by slippy map coordinates.

--bounding-polygon (--bp)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Extracts data within a polygon defined by series of lat/lon coordinates
loaded from a polygon file.

The format of the polygon file is described at the
http://www.maproom.psu.edu/dcw/[MapRoom] website, with two exceptions:

* A special extension has been added to this task to support negative
polygons, these are defined by the addition of a "!" character preceding
the name of a polygon header within the file. See an example on the
link:Osmosis/Polygon_Filter_File_Format[ Polygon filter file format]
page to get a better understanding of how to use negative polygons.
* The first coordinate pair in the polygon definition is not, as defined
on the MapRoom site, the polygon centroid; it is the first polygon
point. The centroid coordinates are not required by Osmosis (nor are
they expected but they won't break things if present and counted as part
of the polygon outline).
* An explicit example is provided on the
link:Osmosis/Polygon_Filter_File_Format[ Polygon filter file format]
page.
* You can find some polygons for european countries at
https://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/osm-extract/polygons/[the
OSM-Subversion]

--buffer (--b)
++++++++++++++

Allows the pipeline processing to be split across multiple threads. The
thread for the input task will post data into a buffer of fixed capacity
and block when the buffer fills. This task creates a new thread that
reads from the buffer and blocks if no data is available. This is useful
if multiple CPUs are available and multiple tasks consume significant
CPU.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These tasks allow bulk operations to be performed which operate on a
combination of data streams allowing them to be combined or re-arranged
in some way.

--sort (--s)

* fail - Stop processing.

 |warn
|=======================================================================

Bound entity processing

Since version 0.40, this task has special handling for the Bound
entities which occur at the beginning of the stream. The processing
happens as follows:

1.  If neither of the source streams have a Bound entity, no Bound
entity is emitted to the output stream.
2.  If both sources have a Bound entity, a Bound entity which
corresponds to the _union_ of the two source Bounds will be emitted to
the output stream.
3.  If one source does have a Bound entity but the other doesn't:
1.  If the source that doesn't have a Bound is empty (no entities
whatsoever), the original Bound of the first source is passed through to
the output stream.
2.  If the source that doesn't have a Bound is not empty, _no Bound is
emitted to the output stream_. Additionally, the action specified by the
"boundRemovedAction" keyword argument (see above) is taken.

--merge-change (--mc)

|=======================================================================

--append-change (--apc)
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Combines multiple change streams into a single change stream. The data
from each input is consumed in sequence so that the result is a
concatenation of data from each source. This output stream stream will
be unsorted and may need to be fed through a --sort-change task.

This task is intended for use with full history change files. If delta
change files are being used (ie. only one change per entity per file),
then the --merge-change task may be more appropriate.

|=======================================================================

--tag-filter (--tf)
+++++++++++++++++++

Filters entities based on their type and optionally based on their tags.
Can accept or reject entities that match the filter specification.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=====================================
|Pipe |Description
|inPipe.0 |Consumes an entity stream.
|outPipe.0 |Produces an entity stream.
|=====================================

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description |Valid Values |Default Value
|filter mode (default) |A two-field dash-separated string which
specifies accept/reject behavior and the entity type on which this
filter operates. |accept-nodes, accept-ways, accept-relations,
reject-nodes, reject-ways, reject-relations |empty string
|=======================================================================

All keyword arguments are interpreted as tag patterns in the form
"key=value". When an entity has a tag that matches one of these
patterns, the entity is accepted or rejected according to the filter
mode. Each tag-filter task filters only the entity type specified in its
mode string, passing all other entity types through without touching
them. If no tag patterns are specified, the filter matches all entities
of the given type. Within a particular tag pattern, multiple values can
be specified for a single key using a comma-separated list. The wildcard
value of * (a single asterisk) matches any value.

The value list separator character, key/value separator character, and
wildcard character ( , = * respectively) can be included in keys or
values using the following escape sequences:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|==============================
|Escape sequence |Replaced with
|%a |*
|%c |,
|%e |=
|%s |space
|%% |literal '%' symbol
|==============================

In practice, there are only limited circumstances where you must escape
these characters:

* = must be escaped in tag keys
* , must be escaped in tag values
* * only needs to be escaped for tag values that consist of a single *
* % and space must always be escaped.

Example usage:

....
osmosis \
  --read-xml input.osm \
  --tf accept-ways highway=* \ 
  --tf reject-ways highway=motorway,motorway_link \
  --tf reject-relations \
  --used-node \
  --write-xml output.osm
....

This will keep only ways with tag highway=(anything), then among those
retained ways it will reject the ones where the highway tag has the
value motorway or motorway_link. All relations are discarded, then all
nodes which are not in the ways are discarded. The remaining entities
are written out in XML. In other words, it produces a file containing
all highways except motorways or motorway links, as well as the nodes
that make up those highways.

Note that each each tag-filter task can accept more than one tag
pattern, and will accept/reject an entity if it matches any of those
supplied tag patterns. For example, the following command will produce a
file containing all POI nodes with amenity, sport, or leisure tags:

`osmosis \` +
` --read-pbf switzerland.osm.pbf \` +
` --tf accept-nodes sport=* amenity=* leisure=* \` +
` --tf reject-ways \` +
` --tf reject-relations \` +
` --write-xml switzerland-poi.osm.xml`

You may need to work on two separate entity streams and merge them after
filtering, especially where the used-node task is involved. If both
inputs for the merge are coming from the same thread (e.g. using the tee
task followed by the merge task), Osmosis will experience deadlock and
the operation will never finish. One solution to this deadlock problem
is to read the data in two separate tasks. The following command will
produce an output file containing all amenity nodes, as well as all
motorways and any nodes referenced by the motorways.

....
../osmosis/bin/osmosis \ 
  --rx input.osm \
  --tf reject-relations \
  --tf accept-nodes amenity=* \
  --tf reject-ways \
  \
  --rx input.osm \
  --tf reject-relations \
  --tf accept-ways highway=motorway \
  --used-node \ 
  \
  --merge \
  --wx amenity-and-motorway.osm
....

PostGIS Tasks (Snapshot Schema)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Osmosis provides a PostGIS schema for storing a snapshot of OSM data.
All geo-spatial aspects of the data are stored using PostGIS geometry
data types. Node locations are always stored as a point. Ways are
related to nodes as in the normal API schema, however they may
optionally have bounding box and/or full linestring columns added as
well allowing a full set of geo-spatial operations to be performed on
them.

Note that all tags are stored in hstore columns. If separate tags tables
are required, check the "Simple Schema" tasks instead.

To perform queries on this schema, see link:#Dataset_Tasks[#Dataset
Tasks].

The schema creation scripts can be found in the scripts directory within
the osmosis distribution. These scripts are:

* pgsnapshot_schema_0.6.sql - Builds the minimal schema.
* pgsnapshot_schema_0.6_action.sql - Adds the optional "action" table
which allows derivative tables to be kept up to date when diffs are
applied.
* pgsnapshot_schema_0.6_bbox.sql - Adds the optional bbox column to the
way table.
* pgsnapshot_schema_0.6_linestring.sql - Adds the optional linestring
column to the way table.
* pgsnapshot_load_0.6.sql - A sample data load script suitable for
loading the COPY files created by the --write-pgsql-dump task.

Osmosis_PostGIS_Setup describes a procedure for setting up
Postgresql/PostGIS for use with osmosis.

--write-pgsql (--wp)
++++++++++++++++++++

Populates an empty PostGIS database with a "simple" schema. A schema
creation script is available in the osmosis script directory.

The schema has a number of optional columns and tables that can be
optionally installed with additional schema creation scripts. This task
queries the schema to automatically detect which of those features is
installed.

available in the osmosis script directory. A load script is also
available which will invoke the COPY statements and update all indexes
and special index support columns appropriately. This option should be

PostGIS Tasks (Simple Schema)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is effectively an older version of the snapshot schema where tags
are still stored in separate tags tables instead of hstore columns. It
is recommended to use the newer "Snapshot Schema" versions of these
tasks where possible due to the improved performance they provide.

To perform queries on this schema, see link:#Dataset_Tasks[#Dataset
Tasks].

The schema creation scripts can be found in the scripts directory within
the osmosis distribution. These scripts are:

* pgsimple_schema_0.6.sql - Builds the minimal schema.
* pgsimple_schema_0.6_action.sql - Adds the optional "action" table
which allows derivative tables to be kept up to date when diffs are
applied.
* pgsimple_schema_0.6_bbox.sql - Adds the optional bbox column to the
way table.
* pgsimple_schema_0.6_linestring.sql - Adds the optional linestring
column to the way table.
* pgsimple_load_0.6.sql - A sample data load script suitable for loading
the COPY files created by the --write-pgsimp-dump task.

Osmosis_PostGIS_Setup describes a procedure for setting up
Postgresql/PostGIS for use with osmosis.

--write-pgsimp (--ws)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Populates an empty PostGIS database with a "simple" schema. A schema
creation script is available in the osmosis script directory.

The schema has a number of optional columns and tables that can be
optionally installed with additional schema creation scripts. This task
queries the schema to automatically detect which of those features is
installed.

available in the osmosis script directory. A load script is also
available which will invoke the COPY statements and update all indexes
and special index support columns appropriately. This option should be

Dataset Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dataset tasks are those that act on on the generic dataset interface
exposed by several data stores. For example the
link:#PostGIS_Tasks[#PostGIS Tasks]. These tasks allow data queries and
data manipulation to be performed in a storage method agnostic manner.

--dataset-bounding-box (--dbb)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Extracts data within a specific bounding box defined by lat/lon
coordinates. This differs from the --bounding-box task in that it
operates on a dataset instead of an entity stream, in other words it
uses the features of the underlying database to perform a spatial query
instead of examining all nodes in a complete stream.

This implementation will never clip ways at box boundaries, and
depending on the underlying implementation may detect ways crossing a
box without having any nodes within that box.

Replication Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These tasks are used for replicating changes between data stores. They
typically work with change streams and can therefore be coupled with
other change stream tasks depending on the job to be performed. However
some tasks work with replication streams which are change streams that
propagate additional replication state tracking metadata. Tasks
producing and consuming replication streams cannot be connected to tasks
supporting standard change streams.

There are two major types of change files:

* Delta - Contain minimal changes to update a dataset. This implies a
maximum of 1 change per entity.
* Full-History - Contain the full set of historical changes. This
implies that there may be multiple changes per entity. Note that the
replication stream tasks work on full-history data.

All change tasks support the "delta" style of changesets. Some tasks do
not support the "full-history" change files.

For more technical information related to Osmosis, read
Osmosis/Replication.

--merge-replication-files (--mrf)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Retrieves a set of replication files named by replication sequence
number from a server, combines them into larger time intervals, sorts
the result, and tracks the current timestamp. This is the task used to
create the aggregated hour and day replication files based on minute
files.

The changes produced by this task are full-history changes.

need to edit the configuration file to specify the time interval to
group changes by.

If no state.txt file exists, the first invocation will result in the
latest state file being downloaded. If you wish to start from a known
point you need to download from
https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute/ the state file of
the start date you want for your replication put it into your with name
state.txt. You can use the
https://replicate-sequences.osm.mazdermind.de/[replicate-sequences] tool
to find a matching file. Take one at least an hour earlier than your
start date to avoid missing changes.

--read-change-interval (--rci)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Retrieves a set of change files named by date from a server, merges them
into a single stream, and tracks the current timestamp.

The changes produced by this task are typically delta changes (depends
on source data).

--read-replication-lag (--rrl)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Task takes the state.txt in an replication working directory and
compares its timestamp (that's the timestamp of the last chunk of that
that osmosis downloaded) with the timestamp of the servers state.txt
(that's the timestamp of the last chunk of that that the server has
produced). It then calculates the difference and prints it to stdout.
Running osmosis with the -q option will prevent logging output from
being displayed unless an error occurs.

--receive-replication (--rr)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Reads a replication data feed from a HTTP server typically served by the
--send-replication-data task. It directly passes the data through a
replication stream to a task supporting changes with replication
extensions such as --replication-to-change. This is intended for use by
clients requiring access to highly current data that the existing
--replicate-change-interval cannot achieve with its polling technique.

As with all replication stream tasks, it operates using a constant
streaming technique that sends data to downstream tasks in multiple
sequences. Each sequence will include an initialize/complete method
call. The initialize method is where state information is exchanged, and
the complete call is where data is persisted/committed. The final
release method call will not be occur until the pipeline shuts down.

Available since osmosis 0.41.

required if the replication server is proxied behind a web server that
is mapping the URL into a child path. In that case the path would
typically be "replication". | |
|=======================================================================

--replicate-apidb (--repa)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This task provides replication files for consumers to download. It is
primarily run against the production API database with the results made
available on the planet server. This task must be used in conjunction
with a sink task supporting replication extensions such as
--write-replication. By default it will extract a single set of data
from the database and pass it downstream, however it may be run in a
continuous loop mode by setting the iterations argument.

All changes will be sorted by type, then id, then version.

The behaviour of this task changed in version 0.41 to send data to a
separate sink task. Previously the --write-replication functionality was
incorporated in this task.

in milliseconds if no data is available. A non-zero value prevents large
numbers of empty files being generated in periods of inactivity, but may
lead to clients thinking they are lagging the server if it is set too
high. Note that an interval may still exceed this value due to the time
taken to process an interval. | |0
|=======================================================================

--replication-to-change (--rtc)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Converts a replication stream to a standard change stream. A replication
stream uses the final sink task to store state, so this task tracks
state using a standard state.txt file in a similar way to other tasks
such as --read-replication-interval. The change data is then sent to the
standard downstream change tasks.

The downstream tasks must support multiple sequences which not all
change sink tasks do. For example, it doesn't make sense for
--write-xml-change to receive multiple sequences because it will keep
opening the same XML file and overwriting the data from the previous
sequence. Other tasks such as --write-pgsql-change are writing changes
to a database and can support multiple sequences without overwriting
previous data.

--send-replication-sequence (--srs)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Exposes a HTTP server that sends replication sequence numbers to
attached clients notifying them when new replication data is available.
The data is sent in a streamy fashion with the connection held open and
new records sent as new replication numbers are created.

This task is not intended for direct consumption by consumers. It is
used by other tasks such as --send-replication-data which sends the
actual replication data to clients. It detects new replication numbers
by being inserted in the middle of a continuous replication pipeline.
For example, it can be inserted between --replicate-apidb running in
loop mode and --write-replication, and will run for as long as
--replicate-apidb keeps the replication stream open.

The URLs served by this task are:

* /statistics - Displays global counters for the server.
* /sequenceNumber/current - Returns the current sequence number. This
number is guaranteed to be available.
* /sequenceNumber/current/tail - As per above, but the connection is
held open and new sequence numbers are returned as they become
available.
* /sequenceNumber/ - Returns the sequence number specified by . It will
block if the number is not yet available, but will error if is more than
1 greater than current. This is not useful on its own, but provided for
consistency with other URLs.
* /sequenceNumber//tail - As per above, but the connection is held open
and new sequence numbers are returned as they become available.

All data is sent using HTTP chunked encoding. Each sequence number is
sent within its own chunk.

Available since Osmosis 0.41.

--send-replication-data (--srd)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Exposes a HTTP server that sends replication data to attached clients
available avoiding the need for client-side polling. The data is sent in
a streamy fashion with the connection held open and new records sent as
new replication data is created. It is intended for cases where the
replication interval is less than 1 minute and the
--read-replication-interval task is unsuitable.

The data sent by this task can be consumed by the --receive-replication
task.

The URLs served by this task are:

* /replicationState/current - Returns the state of the current
replication sequence. The data associated with this state is guaranteed
to be available.
* /replicationState/current/tail - As per above, but the connection is
held open and new state information is returned as it becomes available.
* /replicationState/ - Returns the state of the sequence identified by .
It will block if the number is not yet available, but will error if is
more than 1 greater than current.
* /replicationState//tail - As per above, but the connection is held
open and new state data is returned as it becomes available.
* /replicationState/ - Returns the state of the replication sequence at
or immediately prior to the specified time.
* /replicationState//tail - As per above, but the connection is held
open and new state information is returned as it becomes available.
* /replicationData/current - Returns the state and data of the current
replication sequence.
* /replicationData/current/tail - As per above, but the connection is
held open and new state data and associated data is returned as it
becomes available.
* /replicationData/ - Returns the state and data of the sequence
identified by . It will block if the number is not yet available, but
will error if is more than 1 greater than current.
* /replicationData//tail - As per above, but the connection is held open
and new state data and associated data is returned as it becomes
available.
* /replicationData/ - Returns the state and data of the replication
sequence at or immediately prior to the specified time.
* /replicationData//tail - As per above, but the connection is held open
and new state data and associated data is returned as it becomes
available.

The statistics and replicationState URLs provide data in "text/plain"
format and can be viewed directly in a web browser. The replicationData
URLs provide data in "application/octet-stream" format and must be
treated as binary, with the state "headers" containing data in java
properties format, and the replication data itself encoded in *.osc
format using gzip compression.

All data is sent using HTTP chunked encoding, however it cannot be
assumed that data is aligned with chunks. Each set of state data and
replication data is preceeded by a numeric base-10 ASCII length field
terminated by a CRLF pair.

Available since Osmosis 0.41.

--write-replication (--wr)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Persists a replication stream into a replication data directory. It is
typically used to produce the sequenced compressed XML and state files
produced on the planet server and made available for clients to consume.
Multiple replication sequences will be written to separate consecutively
numbered files along with a corresponding state text file. This works
with tasks such as --replicate-apidb.

Retrieves a set of replication files named by replication sequence
number from a server, combines them into a single stream, sorts the
result, and tracks the current timestamp. Available since osmosis 0.41
(the functionality was previously built into --replicate-apidb).

the standard --read-pbf task except that it allows multiple worker
threads to be utilised to improve performance.

|====================================

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description |Valid Values |Default Value
|file (default) |The name of the file to be written. | |dump.osm.pbf

|batchlimit |Block size used when compressing. This is a reasonable
default. Batchlimits that are too big may cause files to exceed the
defined filesize limits. |Integer value. |8000

|omitmetadata |Omit non-geographic metadata on OSM entities. This
includes version number and timestamp of the last edit to the entity as
well as the user name and id of the last modifier. Omitting this
metadata can save 15% of the file size when exporting to software that
does not need this data. |true, false |false

|usedense |Nodes can be represented in a regular format or a dense
format. The dense format is about 30% smaller, but more complex. To make
it easier to interoperate with (future) software that chooses to not
implement the dense format, the dense format may be disabled. |true,
false |true

|granularity |The granularity or precision used to store coordinates.
The default of 100 nanodegrees is the highest precision used by OSM,
corresponding to about 1.1cm at the equator. In the current osmosis
implementation, the granularity must be a multiple of 100. If map data
is going to be exported to software that does not need the full
precision, increasing the granularity to 10000 nanodegrees can save
about 10% of the file size, while still having 1.1m precision. |Integer
value. |100

|compress |'deflate' uses deflate compression on each block. 'none'
disables compression. These files are about twice as fast to write and
twice the size. |deflate, none |deflate

The simplify plugin filters to drop some elements in order to simplify
the data. Currently it does one extremely crude form of simplification.
It drops all nodes apart from the start and end nodes of every way.

Database Login Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All database tasks accept a minimum of four arguments, these are:

* authFile
* host
* database
* user
* password
* dbType

If no arguments are passed, then the default values for host, database,
user and password apply.

If authFile is supplied, it must point to a properties file with name
value pairs specifying host, database, user and password. For example:

`host=localhost` +
`database=osm` +
`user=osm` +
`password=mypassword` +
`dbType=postgresql`

Note that the properties file doesn't have to contain all parameters, it
may contain only the password leaving other parameters to be specified
on the command line separately.

Command line arguments override the authFile parameters, which in turn
override the default argument values.

Munin Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Together with the --read-replication-lag-Task Osmosis 0.36 contains a
http://munin-monitoring.org/[munin] plugin that graphs the replication
lag, that's the time difference between the local state-file and the
state of the server.

To enable it, locate the munin files in your distribution. They are
located in a subdir named "script/munin/" and follow the following
instructions:

1.  copy "osm-replication-lag" to "/usr/share/munin/plugins"
2.  make "/usr/share/munin/plugins/osm-replication-lag" executable
3.  symlink "/usr/share/munin/plugins/osm-replication-lag" to
"/etc/munin/plugins"
4.  copy "osm-replication.conf" to "/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d"
5.  edit "/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/osm-replication.conf" and set the
workingDirectory
6.  restart the munin-node
